 I select a sample of 12 stocks to be analyzed thorough the variance-covariance matrix and the best risk-return. I then construct a Portfolio Optimized with different methods and costraint and I comment them making also some intuition behind: 
 1) I compute the Mean Variance optimal portfolio allocation (also with non negativity constraint) and I plotted the efficient fronties 
 2) Given the FTSE Italia All Market as a benchmark, I compute the Security Market Line
 3) I implement the  Black-Littermann approach implementing 4 different views (2 absolute and 2 relative)
 4) I Implement a standard Bayesian Asset Allocation assuming conjugate prior normally distributed and a proper prior for the mean, represented by a normal distribution with a mean
    equal to the mean of my vector of returns + 1*standard deviation
 5) I Compute Global Minimum Portfolio Variance
