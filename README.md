I select a sample of 12 stocks to be analyzed through the variance–covariance matrix and their risk–return characteristics. I then construct an optimized portfolio using different methods and constraints, and I comment on the results, providing intuition behind each step:
1) I compute the Mean–Variance optimal portfolio allocation (also with a non-negativity constraint) and plot the efficient frontier.
2) Using the FTSE Italia All Market as a benchmark, I compute the Security Market Line (SML).
3) I implement the Black–Litterman approach, incorporating four different views (two absolute and two relative).
4) I implement a standard Bayesian Asset Allocation, assuming a conjugate normal prior and a proper prior for the mean, represented by a normal distribution with a mean equal to the sample mean of my return vector plus one standard deviation.
5) I compute the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio.
